He
            stepped across, placing his feet carefully on the icy soil. Behind him his son Ilari, not even as tall as
            Lev’s shoulder, had to jump over the stretch of glowing blood. Ilari landed, stumbled, and almost
            stepped back into the stream before he caught his balance. Lev’s expression darkened.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">“Careful. One moment too long, and it’ll burn right through your
            boots.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">Ilari nodded, his face pale. Lev pulled him closer and then pointed as a fresh river
            made its way across the ground. The forest around them was withered and frostbitten, but, along the edges of
            the slow-moving blood, green sprouts shot up and pushed through the icy earth. Ilari’s eyes glittered
            as he watched.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">Lev got them moving before the rivers ran too thick to cross. Just as they reached
            higher ground, their world was plunged in shadow. Lev looked up and back from where the rivers had come
            from.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">Above them, blotting out the sun, was a massive carcass with a gash running along its
            length. Endless torrents of glowing blood rained from it. The mass of flesh hung on iron meat hooks, kept
            aloft by a floating barge. Lev could just make out the smokeless blue fires spilling out from the body of
            the craft. Both of them stared until the barge drifted out of sight and the shadows lifted.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">They travelled in silence, for a space, and Lev pulled out a map and compass. Their
            path soon led to another set of blood rivers. Lev turned to Ilari and asked, “Is this the right
            way?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">“How could I…” Ilari looked at the blood more closely. “The
            river’s too thick here. A working barge wouldn’t stay in place this long.” He paused.
            “Right?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">“Good lad.” Lev patted Ilari’s shoulder. “You’ll be
            tracking on your own in no time.” Ilari beamed.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">They advanced, nearing the source as they went upstream. Eventually they broke into a
            clearing, and heat washed over them in waves.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">The mangled corpse of a behemoth was slumped on the ground with the ruins of a barge
            beside it. This close, they could make out fine details, like the way its body glowed orange between sheets
            of dark armor plating. A spiderweb of light stretched across the armor that had been cracked in the
            fall.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">Lev pulled out his map and started doing rough calculations. Ilari tried not to look
            overwhelmed as he stared up at the towering carcass.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">“What are they going to do with it?” Ilari said.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">“Just because it’s broken doesn’t mean it won’t bleed. Once
            we report back, it’ll probably be hung up again inside the week.” Lev finished his mapmaking,
            thought, and then pulled out his hunting knife “Here, follow me.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">Lev made his way through steaming streams of blood and came to the body itself. The
            air was so hot he could barely breathe. He cut a sliver from the behemoth’s armor; it was a shard of
            obsidian a little larger than his finger. He stepped back and handed it to Ilari.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv">“Something to remember your first landfall by.” Lev smiled as Ilari held
            it like it was the most precious thing in the world. “Now stop gawking and let’s go back. Every
            minute this thing stays on the ground is another mountain of gold wasted.”</span></p> <p class="c2 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c0 svelte-166twvv"> </span></p> <p class="c2 c6 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c3 svelte-166twvv"></span></p> <p class="c2 c6 svelte-166twvv"><span class="c5 svelte-166twvv"></span></p></div></div> </body>
