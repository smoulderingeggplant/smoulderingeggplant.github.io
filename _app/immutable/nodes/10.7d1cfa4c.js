					patterns of black blood just below the skin. A red line at his elbow separated the
					half-formed limb from the intact flesh right above it. Novak’s left hand was
					unblemished and held a long-stemmed pipe; the broken joints of his right hand clutched a
					match. As he tried to light the pipe, his arm shook so much that he almost extinguished
					the match’s flame.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">Beside him, a young merchant named Artois tried not to stare. His eyes kept flicking to
					Novak’s arm and then back to the sky until he ran out of patience.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">“Here.” Artois said, taking the match and holding it to the bowl of the pipe
					until the air turned sour. His movement was smooth, but his eyes looked away, a reflex
					honed over the past few days.
				</span><span class="c4 c3 svelte-1xu88sd">Malchance</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">, the sailors whispered behind Novak’s back. The good luck he would have brought as
					a blood mage was tainted by his deformed arm.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“Thank you, Art.” Novak said.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">“Those smoking leaves are expensive, right?” Artois said, voice high with
					forced levity.</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd"> “I always wanted to take up</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd"> the habit, l</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">ook like some sort of sorcerer</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">—impress the girls in small ports, y’know? Never had enough gold for it
					though.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“They’re cheap back home. They gave it to us as part of our
					rations—helped with the smell of corpses when we dug mass graves.” Novak said.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">Artois fell silent after that. Novak’s mouth turned into a small, bitter smile. His
					ploy for silence was successful. Still, he hoped the merchant wouldn’t leave. Novak
					didn’t want to talk, but he didn’t want to be alone, either.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">Novak leaned over the ships’ edge and watched the waves churning below. When he
					exhaled the smoke formed lazy spirals in the still air. Artois started fidgeting, pulling
					a cutlass from his side and testing its edge with his thumb. Novak tried to ignore the
					weapon. It had a heavy, curved blade, not unlike the cavalry sword that had severed
					Novak’s
				</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">right arm from the elbow down.</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd"> Eight years later, with as many blood rituals as he dared to try, still every
					attempt to remake it had resulted in deformed limbs that drew stares and whispers.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">Novak spoke, then, to stop Artois from continually thumbing the cutlass. “The
					sun’s about to rise. We should feel the Whalers’ wind soon.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“Oh, yes! They’ll be here today, I know it. The captain says they always come
					four days after their scout birds, but that’s not right at all. I know it’s
					three. I can’t wait to hear their song, too.” Artois said, obviously relieved
					to have the silence broken.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“You look forward to the whale songs?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“Yes, of course. I like everything about the Whalers. One of the main reasons I
					went to sea, actually.” Artois said, a little sheepish. “Don’t
					you?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“They’re fine.” Novak said, not wanting to reveal his distaste. A
					sailor like Artois would think that only provincial idiots were afraid of the Whalers.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">They both noticed the pipe’s smoke floating towards them. The breeze then hit their
					faces, growing stronger by the minute. With it came a haunting, ethereal sound. A mimicry
					of whale song, flowing from throats thick with magic. Artois closed his eyes. Novak
					shuddered, the voices setting his skin crawling. It sounded like the funeral laments back
					home.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“Why do they sing?” Novak asked, “It sounds almost guilty, like they
					mourn what they’ve killed.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“No, I heard one of the translators ask them—they said it was about
					honor.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">They both listened to the sound, for a space, each searching for different meanings in
					it. Soon dawn set the water around them alight, and a bellowing voice called the sailors
					to work. Artois left Novak with a hurried goodbye and then disappeared up the rigging.
					Novak went
				</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">belowdecks</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd"> to mend the bone-and-blood talismans the sailors used to stay warm in
					winter—his price for passage.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">Around midday a cry rose from the crow’s nest. They’d spotted a cloud of
					birds on the horizon. Everyone aboard who could spare the time, and a few who
					couldn’t, crowded on the port side of the ship, watching for the Whalers. They kept
					a respectful distance from Novak.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">The flotilla materialized over a quarter hour. Rafts, double-hulled canoes, and long
					ships with triangular sails formed a floating city on the horizon. An urban sprawl of
					masts and ropes and birds and
				</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">whalebone</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">. The crafts were built half from wooden logs and half from massive bones marked with
					glowing blood runes, which fueled the winds they directed.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">Novak sharpened his vision with magic, the veins around his eyes glowing red-hot. He was
					looking for signs of a mage. He could only make out the inhuman figures of the Whalers</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">. </span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">Their torsos were almost like a person’s, but with a single appendage where legs
					should be, r</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">eminding Novak of a snake’s body</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">. Four arms sprouted from their backs, and their heads were flat and reptilian. Whalers
					wrapped around masts, and those on the decks of ships hunched over, their whole bodies
					forming an “S” shape.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">His eyes slid past the serpentine figures, searching for something human. He sifted
					through the flotilla until he saw it: a small ship, single dyed-blue sail, made of wooden
					boards with bones tied to the outside—not Whaler made. On it, Novak hoped, was the
					mage that people only spoke about in hushed breath. Her name had only become more
					legendary once she had disappeared to live among the Whalers.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">As the Whalers’ flotilla neared, sailors brought trade goods up to the deck. Metal
					tools, spices, strange liqueurs, gemstones, and other valuables competed for space. The
					Whalers, for their part, began to lash together their rafts and ships, forming a network
					of gangways and rope bridges. Soon a handful of their ships pulled alongside the
					human’s vessel and laid down wooden ramps to connect them.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">Novak queued behind the merchants and sailors that made their way to neighboring Whaler
					crafts across one of the smaller walkways. He weaved through the translators conversing
					with the Whalers in their guttural, yet melodic, native tongue. His eyes were on the
					mage’s small ship, its small blue sail almost lost in the forest of other masts. He
					traveled across the network of bridges, passing over flat rafts filled with Whalers
					butchering tiger sharks, through a double-hulled canoe packed with crates of furs, and
					walked onto a ship made purely of bone. Whalers dipped their heads to Novak as he passed,
					their eyes not even lingering on his arm. He was soon in front of the mage’s craft,
					feet hesitating for a moment in front of the piece of driftwood that acted as a bridge.
					How would she respond to him, Novak wondered, after having gone so far to leave
					civilization?</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">He boarded the ship with soft steps. “Mélisande?” He said to the air.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">A tall woman emerged from the small cabin at the back of the ship. She wore robes made
					from the skins of sea creatures and carried a bone harpoon half marked with red runes. She
					looked Novak over in the space of two breaths, then sat down on the deck, busying herself
					with the harpoon and a vial of blood.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">“The arm, is it?” She </span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">said without looking at him.</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd"> “I’m sure you think I can heal you. Is that mockery of a limb your
					handiwork?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“It is. I’m no flesh smith.” Novak said, trying to keep the nerves from
					his tone.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“Evidently not.” Mélisande said, then locked eyes with Novak.
					“How did you find me?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“I’ve been living on ships for the past few months. I’ve watched every
					Whaler flotilla for a human craft. It wasn’t hard. I imagine no one else was
					persistent enough to try.” Novak thinks for a moment, and decides honesty would be
					the right approach. “Or desperate enough.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“I suppose not.” Her tone had less acid than before. “Why me, then?
					Surely it would’ve been easier to find a mentor willing to take you in.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“I didn’t learn in an academy, or a monastery.“</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“You got your gift in battle, then.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“Yes, as I was bleeding out.”
					Novak said, rubbing the line between natural and grown flesh at his right elbow. “It
					saved my life.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">“Self taught. The Whalers are, too. Yet they get their gift through
					meditation.” Mélisande swept a hand around her, pointing to all the Whaler
					ships. “Almost every one of them in this flotilla is a mage. Can you imagine what
					that changes?
				</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">How they</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd"> see the world?”<br/>        “Is that why you’re
					here?”<br/>        “One of the
					reasons. Another is that the mountains are already too crowded with hermits and rich
					academies—the ocean is all that’s left. But enough about that. Why are
				</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">you</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd"> really here?” Mélisande looked at Novak’s arm. “Why do you
					want it back so badly? To stop the stares, the whispers, the pity? Or maybe
				</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">its</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd"> regrowth will fix whatever’s misshapen
				</span><span class="c3 c4 svelte-1xu88sd">inside</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd"> of you?” Her tone demanded an answer.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“I used to play the lute, once.” Novak gave her a hint of a smile. He
					didn’t bother making it sound convincing. “It takes two hands. With one all I
					do is smoke.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">The mage looked at him for a long while. Her gaze made his right arm tremble, but he
					didn’t elaborate. He thought she’d like that.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“It’ll take years. You’ll have nothing but me and the Whalers for
					company. Most of your days will be spent gutting fish, maybe drying whale meat. Is it
					worth that much to you?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">“It is.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">“The</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">n I’ll expect you on this ship
				</span><span class="c3 svelte-1xu88sd">before next</span><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd"> sunrise. And get rid of that embarrassment before I see you again.”
					Mélisande said, looking at his arm. Then she turned away, resuming her work on the
					harpoon. Novak clenched his right fist open and closed a few times, and returned to the
					mess of bridges that connected the floating city.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd">Later, as moonlight slid into the waves and Whalers climbed their masts with glowing
					song-filled throats, a small splash next to the human ship went unnoticed. A slender mass
					of bone and flesh disappeared beneath the water. Novak walked across the driftwood bridge
					to the mage’s craft, winding a bandage around the stump of his right elbow.</span></p> <p class="c6 c7 svelte-1xu88sd"><span class="c2 svelte-1xu88sd"></span></p></div></div>`;return{c(){e=c("header"),e.innerHTML=d,t=w(),a=c("body"),a.innerHTML=r,this.h()},l(s){e=p(s,"HEADER",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(e)!=="svelte-16equou"&&(e.innerHTML=d),t=x(s),a=p(s,"BODY",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(a)!=="svelte-ng5h1w"&&(a.innerHTML=r),this.h()},h(){b(e,"class","header-box svelte-1xu88sd")},m(s,l){h(s,e,l),h(s,t,l),h(s,a,l)},p:n,i:n,o:n,d(s){s&&(i(e),i(t),i(a))}}}class H extends g{constructor(e){super(),f(this,e,null,y,m,{})}}export{H as component};
