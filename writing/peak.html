                    The strings shot off in opposite directions, frozen into gravity-defying shapes that almost seemed to mock
                    him. Mist puffed in front of Cillian as he gave an annoyed snort, already imagining what his aunt Ella
                    would’ve said if she saw it. He shook the boots, only managing to get more frost inside them, and the
                    motion dislodged an old memory.</span></p> <p class="c9 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">***    </span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">“You better sleep with anything you don’t want frozen. Here, feel
                    it.” Ella tossed Cillian a small white bottle through the open tent flap.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c10 svelte-1gm0sz8">“Oh, wow. I didn’t even know sunblock </span><span class="c4 svelte-1gm0sz8">could</span><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8"> freeze.” Cillian said as he tried to squeeze the
                    bottle.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">“Sunblock, lip balm, thermoses, socks, dogs, you’d be surprised. If you
                    don’t want it to be an icicle in the morning, put it in your sleeping bag. I can tell you’re not
                    a real backpacker—you didn’t clank every time you rolled over in your sleep. Now put that in a
                    warm pocket and help me pack up.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">She was already dressed and out of the tent, standing next to a pack almost as tall
                    as she was. Ella was wearing her beat-to-hell baseball cap that was probably old enough to vote, and her
                    sun-ravaged skin stood out in the background of white snow. Cillian looked down at the frozen bottle and
                    wondered why anyone would ever do something like this for fun.</span></p> <p class="c7 c9 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">***                </span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">Turning over the boots in his hands, Cillian decided that Ella would’ve seen
                    his negligence as a kind of betrayal. She would’ve chewed him out in that half-laughing way of hers,
                    her slight Irish lilt getting stronger as she pretended to get angrier—but he was alone, 7000 feet
                    above sea level, surrounded by ice and rocks and stunted trees and silence, and Ella was a pile of ashes in
                    his pack.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">She wasn’t even in a real urn. Too fucking pretentious, she’d said. What
                    remained of her body was instead packed inside her favorite oversized water bottle. God, he already missed
                    her sense of humor.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">Now all the mountains seemed dead without her. To Cillian, their majesty was
                    overshadowed by his constant runny nose and altitude headache. He’d trade all the austere, wild beauty
                    for a beige office building with florescent lighting in a second if it meant he’d get central
                    heating.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">He had lied to her, towards the end. It would’ve crushed Ella, wasting away on
                    a hospital bed, to know that he hadn’t set foot on a mountain in years. He said what she wanted to
                    hear, that she had instilled in him a true love of the outdoors, that he never felt more free than in the
                    snow. Remembering that, the boots felt heavy, physical evidence of the truth.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">When Cillian put his first foot in, the sensation skipped past cold, past frigid, and
                    went straight to pain. He tried to laugh at himself, and the pain, as he packed up camp and set off, but
                    ended up muttering constant obscenities to cope.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">There was no real path even at this time of year. All signs of direction were buried
                    under thigh-deep fresh powder. Only two hours later, Cillian was panting, lungs stabbed by the frigid air,
                    legs burning, pack cutting into his shoulders. He was post holing in the snow every other step, and the
                    slope was steep enough that he was climbing more than walking. He was hitting his limit, he could tell, and
                    on this terrain that was dangerous. Of course, Ella wanted to be scattered at the peak—one last
                    challenge, maybe?</span></p> <p class="c9 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">***</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">“You have to know when to stop, right?” Cillian said, sprawled out on a
                    snowbank, sweaty, and eating more than his fair share of snack bars.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">“Nah, fuck that. I’m willing to die. Either I’m walking down that
                    mountain successful, or they’ll have to roll my corpse down for the wake.” She was trying to
                    keep a straight face, and then burst out laughing as she saw Cillian’s horrified expression.
                    “C’mon, no nephew of mine’ll be a quitter!”</span></p> <p class="c9 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">***</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8">Cillian could see the peak above him, now. Less than 500 feet. Just another hour of
                    hell and he’d finally put Ella to rest. “Ah, fuck it.” Cillian turned around, took a
                    breath, and started back down the mountain. There was always next year, and hell, Ella always could take a
                    joke.</span></p> <p class="c6 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c1 svelte-1gm0sz8"> </span></p> <p class="c5 svelte-1gm0sz8"><span class="c2 svelte-1gm0sz8"></span></p></div></div> </body>
