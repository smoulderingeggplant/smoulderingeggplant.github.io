                    According to the prediction engine, when the off-worlders were asked their name, they should “vomit
                    profusely, curl up into a ball, and scream.” I didn’t even know if they </span><span class="c8 c10 svelte-te75zt">could</span><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt"> vomit.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I stepped away from the screen. Aches spiked across me and I felt cramps in muscles I
                    didn’t know I had. I deserved a break, because… damn, even trying to code for the behavior of
                    sentient gasbags had been easier than this.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Just as I prepared to put graphs and equations out of my head, I heard footsteps down
                    the hallway. Of course. I recognized that unsteady gait, the way its heavy steps rang across the whole
                    building. I went back to my console. No luck today, I guess.</span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">A light knocking came from just outside the office.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“May I take a few moments of your time?” The voice was stiff and
                    strained.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“Yeah, yeah, come in.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">They opened the door with slow consideration, but still stomped their way into the
                    room. I still only knew them as “the Mediator.” Apparently partial anonymity would
                    “improve team efficiency by 6.1%.” What a crock of shit. I knew the code well enough to say that
                    maybe you could predict that to the nearest five percent. Maybe.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“We’re having errors,” the Mediator said, “with the behavior
                    modeling. The team has been falling behind because of it.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“Oh, great. What level of problem are we dealing with?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“It appears to be completely broken.” The Mediator started to
                    fidget.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“Broken?” I checked what version the team should be on.
                    “It…shouldn’t be a software problem. We’re using what everyone else
                    is.”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“It’s not functional. Emotional predictions for the team were completely
                    wrong out in the field. With the error values given for their responses,” the Mediator checked some
                    notes, “the conflicts I saw had a one in ten quadrillion chance of happening. I already checked with
                    the wetware techs and they say the implants are working fine. Couldn’t there be an issue with the
                    program itself?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">“Yeah, well, if that’s true then we’d have bigger problems than
                    productivity loss—my advice would be to grab a spear and put all your stuff in a pile. No, this has to
                    be something else. Did you flag the bad predictions?” The Mediator nodded their head. “Okay.
                    I’ll take a look at it. Try to keep them away from each other’s throats, alright?”</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">The Mediator gave me a salute—dead serious, as best I could tell—and left
                    my office. The ones fresh out of the academy were always so embarrassing.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I tried to focus on the problem at hand. Not only were the aliens totally opaque, but
                    now we couldn’t even analyze our own people? I pulled the flagged data.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">It didn’t seem specific to the person. I flipped through various filters of the
                    data, hoping my subconscious would catch some kind of pattern, so I could send it to someone else and go
                    take a nap.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Nothing stood out, so I tried some categories that shouldn’t have any effect.
                    When I organized by location, it all suddenly fell into place. The errors cropped up around the same
                    hotspots, but they seemed to move a bit over time. I overlayed the location data with a map of the region.
                    All the error clusters were suspiciously close to the alien outpost.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">How did that make any sense? Maybe some of their technology interfered with the
                    implants. I didn’t think that was possible, but, well, the data was the data. I thought about what to
                    do next. I could just punt it to the department, but now the problem was clawing at the back of my mind.
                    I’d just throw together a simple experiment.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I grabbed a tablet and synched a simple stimulus-response test to my implant. I went
                    with nostalgia. If there was anything interfering with the implant, it would be obvious enough in what it
                    fed me. I gave the program a quick test, and it flashed a series of images at me, amalgamations of memories
                    of my homeworld. Each one gave me that same blend of wistful regret and happy reminiscence, a record of
                    personal journeys and time long gone. More importantly, the bar on the tablet showed the test’s
                    perfect accuracy rating. It seemed calibrated to me so far.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I set out of my office, passing through narrow corridors and around prefab furniture.
                    There were boxes unpacked everywhere—the whole facility was still a mess. I noticed the background
                    chatter seemed more high-strung than usual. I wondered how well people would do without the predictors.
                    It’d be much easier if we could get a perfect, real-time scan of the brain, I thought. Simulating it
                    would mean you could just know what you were going to do before you did it. Though, seeing that would
                    probably be an input to account for in itself. I shuddered, thinking about the poor bastard who’d one
                    day have to code that recursion.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Finally, I reached one of the doors, exiting the thick canvas walls of the lab. I
                    breathed in, enjoying the natural air. I looked over to the alien domes on the horizon. Our neighbors
                    probably didn’t feel the same way.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I checked to see where the closest one of their patrols would be. I walked over
                    packed-dirt paths, feeling the toll of being cooped up for too long. I still marveled at the open space
                    around me. Back home, a space the size of the lab tent alone would be worth a fortune, not to mention enough
                    open space for aliens to play archeologist in. Then the sound of power drills in the distance broke into my
                    thoughts.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I saw our drones first, circling overhead to record everything and beam the video
                    back to the lab. The aliens came into view next, with their true form obscured by featureless environmental
                    suits. Blank, perfectly reflective helmets covered their faces. I took a moment to mourn the loss of usable
                    data caused by that particular stylistic decision. Borderline rude, that was what it was.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Before I got any closer, I ran the test on myself a few times. It came back
                    fine—if this effect was real, how far away would it stretch?</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">As I approached, some aliens noticed me, and a couple waved their appendages in
                    greeting, but most just focused on their work. By now, they were used to people like me wandering in and
                    out.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I stood far enough away that we’d have to yell to speak to each other, but I
                    was still well within the patrol’s area. I ran the test again. This time, as images of my past flitted
                    by, I still felt that sense of nostalgia, but I noticed myself feeling cramped looking at the stacked
                    buildings of my home planet. That was strange. It didn’t feel like an intrusive thought, but it
                    shouldn’t have come up, and when I checked the test accuracy it was well below acceptable levels.
                    Fascinating.</span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">I drew closer. I was within arm’s reach of one of the aliens, though it ignored
                    me, and I ran the test again. This time I caught myself thinking about the journey to this world. The test
                    was barely correlated with my actual thoughts anymore. Finally, I noticed one of the aliens looking at me. I
                    ran another test, seeing if its focus meant anything.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">The images had me thinking about the logistics of feeding everyone back home. How
                    much power did it take a day, I wondered? Then I checked the test. Its accuracy rating had hit the floor. A
                    part of me started to panic. Was my implant ruined forever? Did they change my brain itself? I walked away
                    from the patrol, then started to move faster, and by the time I was out of sight I broke into an all-out
                    sprint. I raced to the lab, overflowing with theories, questions, and instinctual terror. I stopped outside
                    the entrance, head clearing, and the rational part of me decided to take the test again. This time, it was
                    perfect nostalgia. No anomalies. I calmed down a little, and made my way to the office, wondering just how
                    much of behavioral prediction analysis was about to change. I remembered how the aliens themselves seemed
                    appalled at the idea of the field altogether.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">All of this brought to mind the aliens’ strangely archaic views of philosophy.
                    I pulled up records of translated discussions as a refresher, eyes darting through line after line. It just
                    didn’t add up. How a civilization with a basic grasp of chemistry and neuroscience—not to
                    mention one that’d crossed the stars—could still believe in such a superstitious
                    fantasy…then I took a mental step back, and it started to click.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">If I was right about this, I would have to send out a report as quickly as possible.
                    I readjusted my posture, folding my hind legs into the chair, and started to write.</span></p> <p class="c4 c9 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt"> </span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt"> </span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">174,123 AYU</span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Department of Xeno-Behavioral Predictive Analysis</span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt"> </span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Basic Psychological Profile Report</span></p> <p class="c4 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt"> </span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Alien subject 2568 appears to produce a localized field that results in the
                    malfunction of standard predictive psychology tools. The effect appears to be directly correlated with both
                    proximity and attention from the aliens.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">This effect appears to have influenced the subject’s beliefs. Subject 2568,
                    known to themselves as “children of Terra,” or “humans,” still subscribe to the
                    mathematically disproven concept of free will. Their inducement of a non-deterministic psychological
                    environment may correlate with this strange vestigial viewpoint.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Such an effect could pose many problems to the field of behavioral predictive
                    analysis, both inter- and intra-species, and could induce wider error ranges in even well-established
                    programs. Further research will be required to understand the exact impact on predictive accuracy. The
                    physics-bending nature of this phenomenon may pose a severe challenge to maintaining industry standard
                    prediction rates.</span></p> <p class="c0 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c2 svelte-te75zt">Additionally, there may be some minor philosophical implications to this
                    finding.</span></p> <p class="c3 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c6 svelte-te75zt"></span></p> <p class="c3 svelte-te75zt"><span class="c7 svelte-te75zt"></span></p></div></div> </body>
