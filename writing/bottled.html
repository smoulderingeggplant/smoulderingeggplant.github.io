If you want it to end
					early, vomiting won’t help. It’s all in the lungs. Don’t go anywhere
					quiet, either; they’ll just get louder.” Sofia pauses. “Enjoy meeting
					the city.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The glass bottle she hands over is small, almost smaller than her hand, but heavy. Vapor
					dances inside of it, shifting from one color to the next. The girl Sofia hands it to looks
					frail, her eyes already wide, fingers trembling a little. The man sitting with his arm
					around her tries to give a reassuring smile and hands Sofia a small stack of banknotes.
					Thin red paper, small denominations—the face of the Interim President looks back at
					her.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia pockets the notes, feeling the absence of bottles in her bag. Only one left, and
					it’s not for sale. She ducks out of the room with its damp wallpaper, peeling sofa,
					and people breathing anything but air.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The hallway outside is a riot of voices, another offshoot of the squatter party.
					They’ve lined the walls with random pieces of furniture to sit on or lie across.
					There are gas lights on the wall, left dark, and the space is illuminated by kerosene
					lamps. The window on the far end of the hallway is broken, only a nailed-in tarp keeping
					out the snow, and Sofia sees people’s breath mist in the cold. They don’t seem
					to care. Sofia picks her way through the tangle of legs, broken drawers, and discarded
					bottles. She eavesdrops as she walks.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Two students, university-aged, are perched on a wooden dresser. One of them is talking
					loudly about some ancient religion, and she seems too drunk to notice that the other girl
					doesn’t care. Is she letting her talk out of politeness, Sofia wonders, or
					affection? It was so much harder to tell when she couldn’t hear their thoughts.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia rounds the hallway and turns down a staircase, also lined on either side with
					people. It’s slow going. She keeps her ears open as she descends.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“It was the last war, man, has to be. No country will want to fight after
					that.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“No. No, I think they still will. Except next time there’ll be nothing left
					but mustard gas and bomb craters. You hear what happened in the north of Atelán?
					Last cavalry charge, they’ve been calling it. Whole regiment was wiped out by
					machine gun fire. My dad was there. Said it was a meat grinder…”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The conversation is lost as Sofia makes it to ground level. What was once a grand foyer
					is now filled with a crowd, milling atop a floor of old debris and fresh trash. Sofia
					turns sideways to push through them, dodging held drinks and stepping over passed-out
					partygoers. She reaches the door to the outside and pushes on the cast iron frame.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Cold air washes over her. The drunken shouts bouncing between cramped walls fades and is
					replaced by the howl of snow-laden wind. It’s dark, well past the city’s
					curfew. The electric street lamps lining the street are left off. Most of the light came
					from upper-story windows. Sofia did some calculation in her head—her apartment was
					about a mile and a half away. If she didn’t get arrested, she’d probably get
					mugged in the dark walking there. Better to find a friend’s place to crash. She
					doesn’t like sleeping in her place, anyway. A small part in the back of her mind
					knows that’s why she stayed out so late.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia pulls the last bottle out. It feels warm to the touch, but that might be the
					anticipation. She runs her thumb along the glass, feeling the letters “Haliogen
					A50B” across it. Medical grade, with a label to match. Any serious user just calls
					it
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">voza</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">She brings it to her lips, flipping the small rubber valve at the top open. She takes a
					shallow breath that drains half the bottle. It tastes like a mix of ethanol and burnt
					hair. There’s a brief, terrible moment when the shouts of the crowd indoors are too
					muffled to pick out words, and the visions don’t start, and she’s left with
					her own thoughts. Then
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">voza</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> works its magic. Sounds first, then whole experiences.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">It begins with a voice raw from anger. </span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">“I love you...I miss you. Fuck you for leaving.”  </span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Next a tired, careful voice.</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> “He died, ma’am, on the overnight train.”
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Then the images:</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> A lightbulb burns out as she sits holding back tears, in an empty theater.
					There’s dust on the seats.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Flashes of lives across the city of New </span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Lliroma</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">. Other thoughts, other feelings, other people that she can inhabit, if only for a few
					minutes.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Snow dusts her </span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">hair, now</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">. Sofia starts walking towards a nicer neighborhood, with fewer abandoned buildings.
					It’s more for warmth than any sense of direction. Who would let her stay the night?
					Right now she doesn’t care. She wants to walk the empty streets and wait for more
					visions.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">The road beside her is narrow, built with cobblestones. Not meant for cars. The tenement
					buildings are skinny, three stories high, and crumbling. The sidewalks are deserted.
					Should she just walk back, deal with the risk? But there was no one to come home to. No
					one who would</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t"> make</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> stovetop coffee with cinnamon and cloves every morning.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">She’d already thrown out his pan and all the bags of spices. She sprayed the
					apartment down with lemon juice, and bleach. The smell is still always there.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia closes her eyes. </span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">Ringing, from a fogged-up phone booth. The bartender calls home to his mom, and is asking
					for help without being able to say it. He hangs up before he can form the words.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The vision helps, but it’s not enough. Her thoughts still spiral around the smell.
					She needs something more. A stronger pain to immerse herself into.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia stops, and turns west. She can just make out the glow of floodlights on the clouds.
					The demilitarized zone and, beyond it, the Democratic Confederacy of Atelán.
					It’s worse there, on the other side, with enough suffering for a hundred lifetimes.
					Sofia concentrates and hopes she can tap into it.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Flashes of experiences. </span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">A child waits in a bombed out school—barbed wire fences and machine gun
					nests—soil too frozen to dig a proper grave—a soldier looking inwards, more to
					keep his own people in than the “enemy” out.</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> Then something longer.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">There’s a fire in the hearth. A black iron pot over it. The gas stove nearby is
					cold, pipes long empty. The smell of cooking onions and bone broth winds around the room,
					a faint tang of woodsmoke behind it.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">“Will this be a long winter?” His sister asks, wrapped up in blankets. He
					looks out at the dark outside.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">“Yeah, I think so.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">“That doesn’t have to be a bad thing.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">The snow batters their window. It makes the fire warmer, somehow. He smiles. “No, I
					guess not.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia shivers, feeling the fireless chill she walks in. Maybe the pain isn’t what
					she needs right now, she thinks. It’s time to find someone to take her in.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">She remembers her own shared meals. He was there, and sometimes his sister, too. Sofia
					pictures all three of them in a cramped kitchen, each trying to make dinner the
					“right way.” It was long past time to reach out…but no. Too much
					history. Not tonight. Better to find someone else.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">She had five friends near her apartment, three of whom still trust her. Too far. A couple
					friends near the city center, a mile away. A couple dozen half-friends in the tenements
					who’d let her stay, but only if she had something to sell them.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">An idea comes to her. She takes out the bottle of half-used voza. Breathing anymore would
					be enough to hospitalize a new user, but she’s built up a year-long tolerance.
					She’s also gotten better at directing her attention. Sofia inhales around half of
					what remains. While it hits her throat, she thinks about old friends, and focuses on the
					area around her.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">An unfamiliar face brewing herbal tea. Next, a coworker from long ago, reading her
					son’s article in the newspaper and smiling with pride. Then Rafi, tinkering with a
					military surplus radio. He’s focused but not frustrated. Tools are laid out in a
					neat pile on the floor.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Ah, Rafi. He’s close by, barely a five minute walk. He’ll probably take her
					in—if he doesn’t realize she&#39;s on voza, at least. They hadn’t been
					that close. No matter what, he won’t appreciate being interrupted. Better to find
					somewhere to wait for a while. She heads towards his apartment block.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia wonders if other people use the visions like she just did. She entertains herself
					with the idea of government spies in the basements of Atelán, lungs filled with
					pure voza, tracking possible enemies of the state. It doesn’t seem that unlikely,
					once she thinks about it for a while.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">A thick column of light, street level, shines in the distance. Sofia could make out
					Rafi’s building nearby. As she approaches, she realizes it’s from a corner
					store.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The metal grate is open, and there are a few customers milling inside it. Completely
					illegal under curfew, of course. Still, it’s a nicer place than the street to wait
					while Rafi finishes tinkering.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">A girl with too many memories, little thought for the present, and no plans for the
					future. She leans over a body, gone cold, with red marks crawling up and down its arms.
					She takes money from
				</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">its</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> jacket pocket. She wants to say a prayer for the dead, but doesn’t know how.
					When she leaves, the door is left open.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">A bell jingles as Sofia steps inside. It’s warmer than the snow, but not that warm.
					The clerk behind the counter is about Sofia’s age, with the kind of short haircut
					that women had to get when they started working war-time factory jobs. She waves at Sofia,
					and then continues organizing something. The other people inside ignore her. Sofia decides
					it’d be rude to stay in the store for free. She picks out a carton of cigarettes
					from the half-empty shelves, and approaches the counter.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Oh, you don’t have to buy anything. I know it’s cold out.” The
					store clerk says.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“No, no, I needed these anyway.” Sofia smiles at the store clerk as she rings
					up the carton. “How do you stay open this late? Most places at least pretend to be
					closed.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">The clerk shrugs. “The militia needs to buy gum, bad coffee, and
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">smokes</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> as much as anyone, I guess.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Even in this neighborhood?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Especially in this neighborhood! They even complained, one time, when I turned off
					the lights.” A little laughter creeps into the clerk’s voice.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia tries to hold on to the conversation as voza drips other lives into her brain.
				</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">He looks at a foreclosed storefront, rubbing at the key in her pocket until his finger
					bleeds. He decides that he still has enough days left to build something, world be damned.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia busies herself handing over money and taking the carton while the vision plays. She
					speaks once it’s over. “</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">You</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> mind if I smoke inside?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“...I’d prefer it if you didn’t.” Some part of the clerk’s
					look tells Sofia that the militia aren’t considerate enough to step out.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“That’s fine. I’m alright outside, anyway.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia emerges into the snow, again, and has to shield her lighter’s flame from the
					wind. Tobacco smoke and voza mingle inside her lungs. She coughs a little. She focuses on
					the burning in her lungs, making the visions come indistinct, just emotions. Flashes of
					others’ nostalgia, grief, and lounging.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Half the carton and a few minutes go by. Sofia decides it’s time to talk to Rafi.
					She leaves the store’s column of light and makes her way to the side door of the
					apartment building. It’s unlocked, as she had hoped, probably as part of building
					codes. There are no fire escapes in the tenements.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The staircase is made of splintered wood, but at least there are lightbulbs hanging from
					the ceiling. Sofia starts her way up. Unit 402. Her breath comes up short when she reaches
					his door. She knocks on it.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Who is it?” Rafi’s voice is clear through the thin walls.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Sofia!”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Sofia?” There’s quick footsteps, the sound of a metallic object
					falling, and then the door opens. Rafi leans against the doorframe, lanky, curly hair
					looking overgrown, with bags under his eyes and oil staining his hands. “What are
					you doing here? And, well, it’s good to see you again, also. Sorry.” He still
					blocks the door.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">“Had a late night, Rafi. I’d walk home, but </span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">curfew already</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> started. I know it’s last-minute, but I was wondering…could I sleep on
					your couch tonight?” Sofia wonders if he’ll be able to tell. The pupils
					don’t dilate on voza, there’s no twitching, or stuffy nose, or needle marks.
					Just distracted attention.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Rafi’s eyes narrow. “You haven’t gone back to working at the chemical
					plant, have you?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“No.” She searches for an explanation, an excuse, a lie, anything. “The
					war’s over, it’s hard finding work there.”<br>        “You’re still selling, then,
					aren’t you?”</span></p> <p class="c8 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">        Sofia goes quiet.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">Hundreds of New </span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">Lliromans</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> in the seconds before they reach for the fumes. Vain individuals seeking ego death.
					Selfish students ready to philosophize about the death of the Individual. The lonely
					people who want a connection, any connection, a hundred thousand connections all at once,
					the ache so familiar it hurts. Then they inhale, and their thoughts merge with the chorus.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">“Shit, Sofia.” Rafi says. “You&#39;re still </span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">using</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">, too. Are you high right now?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“No!” She can’t quite meet his eyes. “Not really. It’s not
					a real high, Rafi, not really.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Bullshit.”<br>        “It&#39;s medicine! They use it to
					treat soldiers with shell shock. It’s not like I’m—”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“That’s what you’re doing? Treating shell shock? That’s what all
					those fuckups in the derelicts are doing? No, I can’t deal with this. I’m not
					going to enable you. Go pass out in an abandoned tenement, with the other junkies.
					Goodnight, Sofia. And sorry.” He slams the door closed.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The sound of the door is like a gunshot. Sofia jumps backwards. She thinks about pounding
					on the door, screaming at Rafi, yelling every curse she knows. Instead, she lets herself
					go numb. She half-expected this, at least.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia turns around, walks down the stairs, and leans against the outside wall of the
					building. She takes out the half-empty carton, and smokes again, slower than last time.
					Not trying to keep the visions away, not inviting them, either.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia stands there, waiting for a vision, or maybe for a militia car to run away from.
					Then, in the distance, some figure walks out of the darkness. She wears a white hooded
					tunic, bordered in red, the crisp uniform at odds with their surroundings. She must be a
					nun of some local order. Dedicated to abandoned children, Sofia thinks, based on the
					colors. The nun notices approaches with steady steps, until she’s within arm’s
					reach.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t"> The nun asks Sofia, “Do you mind?” gesturing at the carton. Sofia hands
					over a cigarette, and the nun mutters a quiet, exhausted “thank you.” Sofia
					thinks she could probably use something stronger.</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> </span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">“It’s nice.” He said, as she leaned into him. The apartment really was
					nice. Small, but cozy. Close to the garment district, far from the demilitarized zone. She
					let herself
				</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">relax, a</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> little. They could make a life here.</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> </span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">That one hurts, more than the others. Sofia realizes she let the cigarette burn down to
					her fingertips, too wrapped up in the vision to notice. The nun is looking at her with
					kind but knowing eyes.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">“What do you see, child?” The nun asks. Sofia wonders how many far-off
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">voza</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> stares she’s witnessed.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“A happy couple.” Sofia flicks away the cigarette butt.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“You look too angry for it to be that.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“I don’t want to…” Sofia trails off. The nun just keeps staring
					at her. Sofia sighs. Hell, if not a nighttime nun, then who? “Alright, okay.
					I’ll tell you. It’s about my husband.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“He proposed to me during the war, while he was on leave. We were engaged by the
					time he had to go back. Every day I worked in the factory, mixing the chemical
					 precursors for bombs and grenades and bullets, and it was impossible not to think of
					him out there.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“By some miracle, he came back in one piece after the ceasefire. He’d gotten
					shot in the leg, but it wasn’t serious. More importantly, he’d been spared
					from shell shock. We had the wedding as soon as we could. I was married at twenty-two;
					five years older than my parents had been. I thought we were so progressive. So old. A
					real couple, fit for the modern age. I was even going to go back to school, once we had
					the money. Learn about the future. Electricity, phones, cars, anything.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">“But he had a dry cough. It was normal, nothing serious; that’s what we told
					ourselves, anyway. We had three years together, and then he started coughing blood. He had
					spent months ducking bullets and artillery shells and canisters filled with mustard gas,
					and then he
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">comes</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t"> home and </span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">dies</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t"> of tuberculosis.” Sofia swallows, trying to keep her voice steady. “His
					name was Arlo.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">A </span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">grey</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> haired man cooks dinner alone, a picture set on one side of his table. It’s
					old; his husband stares out. So young, then, but there’s still sickness behind his
					eyes. Candles burn around it.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The nun reaches out and puts a hand on Sofia’s shoulder, her touch light, and then
					she pulls back, a little awkward. How do you console an adult?</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Do you have somewhere to sleep tonight? The temple—” The nun begins to
					say.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“No. Thank you, but I have a place to stay.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The nun has the same worried expression. “Where?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“With Lucía.” The answer slips out of Sofia before she can think to
					stop it. “Arlo’s sister. My sister-in-law.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The nun holds eye contact a moment longer, then nods. There’s a silence between
					them, for a while. Sofia finally says, “I should go,” and starts walking.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">The nun just says “Thanks for the cigarette.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia walks then, when out of sight, runs. She goes down a few blocks at random. Left,
					right, right again. She stops. Memories of Arlo and Lucía push up to the surface,
					too powerful for even voza to hold down.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Lucía had stayed with them for a couple months, about a year after the wedding.
					She’d been laid off, and didn’t want to have to pay rent. Sofia was annoyed,
					at first. Now she’d do anything to go back to those weeks.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">The arguments filled with laughter, late at night, over empty plates. They’d joke
					and yell about politics and art until their neighbors pounded on the floor with brooms.
					Arlo claimed that the new film cameras would cause painting to become obsolete.
					Lucía argued that the old masters already figured out how to paint the world, and
					the rest of history would be filled with talentless artists turning their canvases into
					masses of colored blobs. Sofia defended the impressionists, saying they captured emotion
					in every brushstroke, and that no camera would replicate that. None of them ever changed
					their minds. She wouldn’t recognize
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">herself now</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia’s breath makes small clouds as she leans on her knees, panting. There’s
					no escape from the past after that. Well, not unless she does something stupid. Sofia
					pulls out the bottle one last time.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">A quarter left. In the darkness of the street, she can’t see the shifting rainbow
					of color inside it. It’d be risky, using the rest. She’d done it once before,
					though. Whatever she saw that time wasn’t real. A real hallucination, not a vision.
					Well, fuck it, Sofia thinks. She inhales the rest of the voza.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Her feet give out beneath her. Her vision twists in vortices of light. She tries to
					breathe in, but it’s as if the air rushes just out of reach around her. And
					then—</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t">Streets flowing, turning radiating outward. The wind flows between rows of buildings,
					placing snow on gutters, tree branches, the shoulders of those still walking at night. The
					hum of radio waves permeates the world, words, music, coded language mixing with a
					waterfall of emotions. The thoughts are tangible. They deflect snow drifts, scare off
					small birds. They’re beautiful. They fade in seconds.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">There’s a militia motor carriage coming. From the north. </span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">Your</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> left, Sofia.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">She jolts upright, then falls onto her hands and knees. She still can’t stand up
					straight. From around a corner, to the left, the glow of a headlight emerges. Sofia crawls
					into a subbasement’s staircase, hidden from view. The motor carriage swings around
					the corner, covered in militia insignias, and Sofia waits for it to pass.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Is someone there? Do you know me?” She&#39;s speaking aloud, her voice
					scratchy and low.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">The snow-capped trees, the broken glass </span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">scattered</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> on street corners, the drunks and dreamers have all seen you walk home with him,
					and alone. And I’ve seen you.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia thinks through the haze of voza and oxygen deprivation. That first vision
					didn’t feel like a person. It felt like the city. “New
				</span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">Lliroma</span><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">? Is that…”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">Four major religions have tried to convert me. Seventeen minor ones. All failed. Amateur
					spiritualists sit in basements and hovels and staircases and gutters, all trying to piece
					people back together, failing to for themselves. Now fresh visionaries are lightheaded
					with the fumes you sell. They see a new world built with love and understanding, one
				</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">inhale</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> away. It won’t be enough, no matter how many bottles you push. All utopias
					come to die here. And yet you love me. New
				</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">Lliroma</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">. You hear me with or without the
				</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">voza</span><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">. </span><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">It pauses, for a moment.</span><span class="c3 c2 svelte-pdcn9t"> He loved me, too.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia searches for words, and then the right question with them. “Is there some
					part of Arlo still alive—some portion of his soul? He can’t just be
					memories.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 svelte-pdcn9t">There’s nowhere else, Sofia. This is it. Frosted windows and broken people. The
					snow, the barbed wire, the lamp-lit evenings. Lungs red from anything that will dull the
					pain.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c4 svelte-pdcn9t">She stays silent.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c2 c3 svelte-pdcn9t">You still have breath left. It can be enough. It has to be.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia manages to stand. She sees a phonebooth, in the distance. She limps towards it. The
					door is almost too frozen to open.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">She has just enough coins for a single call. She dials by instinct. She doesn’t
					even know what she says to the switchboard operator, only registering when the other end
					is picked up.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Lucía? Are you there?” Sofía’s voice is small.</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Oh, God.” There’s a kind of choking sound. “Sofia, is that
					really you? Where have you been? All we’ve heard is rumors. Why haven’t you
					talked to us? To me?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“I don’t know. I didn’t know how to share it. To talk about his death.
					And the rumors you’ve heard are probably true.” There’s only
					interference on the other end for a few seconds.<br>        “Are you okay? You sound
					sick.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“No, I’m not okay.” Sofia says. “Can I sleep at your place
					tonight?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Yes, of course. Where are you?”<br>        “I can get there in a few minutes,
					don’t worry. Hey, Lucía?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Yeah?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“I’m high, right now, on voza. Will you still let me stay?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“Yes, Sofia. God. Of course. You’re sure you don’t want me to come get
					you?”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">“It’s fine. I’ll be there soon.”</span></p> <p class="c1 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c0 svelte-pdcn9t">Sofia sets the receiver down. The city only spoke to her in the language of rustling tree
					branches, of the wind making gaps in the phonebooth sing. There were no voices in her
					head, despite the voza in her blood. She let herself cry. She’d almost forgotten
					what tears felt like on her own face, what it was like to breathe for her own lungs, to
					hear the world and realize that it was enough.</span></p> <p class="c7 c6 svelte-pdcn9t"><span class="c3 c10 svelte-pdcn9t"></span></p></div></div> </body>
